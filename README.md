# automation-connect-with-profiles-linkedIn
This is a script written in python to add connections with linkedin profiles. Since growing your connections is an important thing as a developer, I thought of making a script that automates this process. All what you have to do is to open this script in any IDE and just replace your email and your password.
Make sure to have selenium webdriver on your computer.
